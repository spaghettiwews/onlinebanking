    <h1>Security tips for online banking</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable Multi-Factor authentication to add an extra layer of security when accessing your internet banking account.</li>
        <li>Use a password manager to generate and store strong password(s) for your internet banking accounts.</li>
        <li>Always check the URL in your browser address bar to make sure you are on your actual website's domain and not some random website that's pretending to be your bank.</li>
        <li>Sign up for SMS notifications for your bank accounts so that when any transactions are done on there you are notified in real time.</li>
        <li>Only access the internet banking site by following the link on your bank's website rather than Googling it and clicking the first link that appears. Better yet, manually type it in yourself if it's a memorable address.</li>
        <li>Never share your internet banking credentials via email. Your bank will never ask you for sensitive details like that over email.</li>
        <li>If you get a call from a person saying that they are from your bank, take their name, end the call and  call the bank back using the number you have on file or the one from their website.</li>
        <li>Don't give out sensitive information (e.g. One Time Passwords) via the phone/email. Your bank will likely never ask you for these anyways.</li>
        <li>Before logging into your internet banking account make sure the SSL certificate is valid and hasn't expired. Modern browsers will typically warn you if it has expired.</li>
        <li>Closely scrutinise all emails coming from entities claiming to be your bank. Check that the email addresses and links are using the correct domain.</li>
    </ul>
